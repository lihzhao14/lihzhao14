- ðŸ”­ Hello! I'm currently a dedicated Master's candidate pursuing my degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. My primary focus lies in digital integrated circuits, Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI), and embedded systems (also including PCB), an area where I've accumulated considerable experience and expertise.

- ðŸŒ±Iâ€™m currently studying at UPenn. @ESE.

- ðŸ‘¯I am actively seeking internship opportunities in the realm of digital circuits and embedded systems in Summer 2023 and Fall 2023, where I can continue to grow, learn, and contribute my skills. I am excited about the prospects of bringing my practical knowledge and theoretical understanding to the table, and I look forward to engaging with innovative and challenging projects in this field.
